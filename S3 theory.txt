

1.)Dfferentiate block storage and object storage

Storage Types:- Block Storage & Object Storage (53)

Block storage:

1 Block storage is a suitable for transmitting Data, read/write speed load and structured the database.
2 Block storage divides the data and stored into evenly sized blocks and they called as a Data Chunks.
3. We are going to store demo.txt file in instance, this file will spilt into the evenly sized blocked before stored.
4. This block storage would not be contain the metadata.
5. Block storage only keep Address, inode number where the our data blocks are stored.
6. Example SSD, HDD


Object storage:
1 In object storage it will store the file and it will not divide the blocks.
2 Object file is just like data itself, it's metadata has object global uniqueid
3. Object storage can not be mounted as a drive..
4. Example: DropBox, Drive, S3

2.)Difference between Static Website & Dynamic Website?

a.Static Website     
                                                                                        
Content of Web pages cannot be change at runtime
No interaction with database possible.
It is faster to load as compared to dynamic website
Cheaper Development costs.
No feature of Content Management.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript is used for developing the website.
Same content is delivered every time the page is loaded.


b. Dynamic Website
Content of Web pages can be changed.
Interaction with database is possible
It is slower than static website.
More Development costs.
Feature of Content Management System.
Server side languages such as PHP, Node.js are used.
Content may change every time the page is loaded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3.)What are the naming rules?
Below are some naming rules of bucket.

	Bucket should be globally unique & by default it is private
	Only lower characters can be useable
	Bucket name can not be change after creation
	Min 3 & max 63 character can be use
	Bucket name should not be Ip address/domain name.
	We can use . and _ in middle of character

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.)What is the measure resource of S3 Bucket?

	Objects
	 access control list (ACL)
	bucket policies
	 replication configurations 
	bucket versioning 
	lifecycle policies 
	cross origin resource sharing 
	event notifications
	storage classes 
	static website hosting

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.)Why do we need to host static website instead of dynamic website?

only Static website is hosted in S3 Bucket.
The reason we only host static website is that the database is not attached to static website. Also the cost is low for static website.
we does not require all time chnges in static website.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.)What is versioning & why we need versioning?

a.Handle the multiple version of an objects in the same bucket.
   b. We can restrive & restore the every version of every object stored in our amazon s3 bucket.
  c. We can use and access it while verion failure.
  d. We can store multiple file with same name and different content.
  e. Example python.pyâ†’ abc (august), python.py (october) 
  f.That's why we can store one file with multiple versions

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.)What are the objects & types of objects we are uploading in S3 bucket?
Objects are the any type of data user stored in s3 bucket,
Ex. PDF file, text doc., images, videos etc.
Each object has its own unique object ID provided by AWS 
We can store max 5TB size of data/object in single s3 bucket

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.)Why is MFA Delete important in S3 Bucket object level?
Below are some key features of MFA Delete: 
Protect to changing bucket versioning state
Avoid permanently deleting an object or its version
to set object level granular permission & data protection

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.)What is S3 multipart uploading?

Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. 
If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts.

Ex. Suppose we have 100 mb file so we can also upload 10 files of 10 mb parallel for faster uploading.
Once all sets uploading done it will stored in S3 Bucket as a single object.
We can apply it for more that 100 mb file & it is must for more than 5GB file

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.)What are the storage classes in Amazon S3?
Below are the storage classes of S3:
S3 Standard AI
S3 Intelligent-Tiring
S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (Z-IA)
S3 Glacier
S3 Glacier Deep Archive

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.)What is ACL?
ACL stands for Access Control List. 
it defines which AWS accounts/user or groups are granted access and the type of access.
Basically ACL is a set of rules or policies that define who can access objects and what level of access they have within a specific S3 bucket
We can enable ACL on bucket level as well as object level. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12.)Why do we need ACL?
ACLs are used to manage permissions for individual objects and buckets, allowing or denying access to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, groups, or other AWS accounts

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13.)What is lifecycle policy & why do we need to use lifecycle rule?

A Lifecycle policy allows you to automatically manage and control the lifecycle of your objects stored in S3 buckets.
With lifecycle policies, you can define rules to transition objects between different storage classes, delete older versions of objects, and automate the expiration of objects.
Lifecycle policy helps you optimize storage costs, improve performance, and ensure compliance with data retention policies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14.)How can we make our bucket public?
By enabling block public access option we can make our bucket public

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.)How can we give public access to our bucket?
Enable ACL for bucket 
Edit ACL,  give list & read permission to everyone/public for bucket

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16.)AWS pricing factor of the S3 Service?
Storage Pricing: The primary factor is the amount of data you store in your S3 buckets & storage prising is different for each storage class. 

Request and Retrieval Costs: Amazon S3 charges for each request made to your bucket, such as GET, PUT, COPY, LIST, etc & for data retrieval as well


Data Transfer Costs:Data transfer costs apply when data is transferred into or out of Amazon S3. 

Data Transfer Acceleration (Transfer Acceleration):Transfer Acceleration allows you to accelerate your uploads to S3 using the CloudFront content delivery network. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17.)How can we make our object public?
Enable Block Public Access to make object public

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18.)How can we configure the static website logs in S3?
We have to enable server access logging function to configure static website logs in s3. 

 Server access logging capture detail information about requests made to bucket which help to analysis access patter.

We can target/ create another bucket to store all logs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19.)What is CORS?
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. 
It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources hosted on another domain.
CORS prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
Mostly it is use in web development to enable secure cross origin communication.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20.)What is S3 Inventory?
S3 Inventory provides scheduled reports about objects and their metadata within an S3 bucket. 
With S3 Inventory, you can generate reports to help you better understand, manage, and audit your S3 object metadata. 
These reports can be useful for compliance, data governance, and data lifecycle management.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21.)What does it mean by requestor pay?
Requester Pays allows the bucket owner to configure a bucket so that the requester (the entity making the request for data) bears the cost of the data transfer and
 request costs associated with accessing objects in the bucket.
 In a typical S3 bucket, the bucket owner pays for all the costs associated with data transfer and requests. 
With Requester Pays, the requester is responsible for these costs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22.)What is secondary word to transfer acceleration? Why do we need to use this transfer acceleration?
Secondary word to transfer acceleration is Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration.
Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances with the help of cloud front CDN.
Need of transfer acceleration:
It increase data transfer speed & give consistence performance.
Reduce latency issues.
Provide secure data transfer.
